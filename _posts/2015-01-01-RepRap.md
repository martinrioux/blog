In 2012, the RepRap 3D printers community was expanding and I decided to have my go at making my own 3D printer based on the RepRap Mendel design. Iâ€™ve gathered all the parts I needed from different suppliers and spent many evening building my 3D RepRap while I was still studying in Microbiology.

As of now, it is slower and bulkier than newer models, but it served me well over the years. I brought it to several places, including science booths and workshops, and it never failed to interest people in these time were 3D Printing was still unknown to most people.
