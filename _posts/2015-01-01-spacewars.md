Here is a clone of the game Zatacka, made with Panda3D.
This game allow up to 25 people to play at the same time using custom controller and was meant to be used at the Quebec Engineering Games. Even though the game was finished, it wasn't used due to a lack of resources. In fact, it was replaced by game in the RGB_speed_game folder of this repo. Though it is not in the final version, it is possible to control the game using an Arduino.
**About Panda3D**: Panda3D is an open source C++ game engine with python binding. There are no visual editors for this game engine.

The code is avaible in my repository my repository [Zatacka-Panda3D](https://github.com/martinrioux/Zatacka-Panda3D).
