The Escape Room compagny *La Société - Jeux d'évasions* was just getting started in 2017. I reached out to them to offer my services for designing and making their electronics. They were super enthousiastic and this is how I got started making electronic puzzles for them. We had a lot of fun talking about all that could be done!

## Demo Box

The first project was a demo box that they could bring to events so people can get an idea of what are “Escape Room” puzzles.

It is a simple box with a lock and a keypad on which you must enter the right combination. A piezo buzzer and LEDs are used to give the players feedback. On a successful combination entered, the box unlocks and shows the next clue (or congratulation note).

If a secret combination is entered, the combination can be edited.

## Lost at Sea - Escape Room

On of the first Escape Room they created was titled "Lost at Sea", where I did all of the electronics and software.
A python script was used to input user answers to various puzzles. A Arduino was used as the Software-Hardware interface.

I only kept picture of one of the puzzle that is part of the room, which is the suitcase displayed above and bellow.
