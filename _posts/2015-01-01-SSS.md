## SpaceShip Simulator (SSS)
Sometime, you've got a project that you really got to heart. For me, it's my SpaceShip Simulator.
I’ve always enjoyed games which engage interaction and I developed over the years an idea for a game in which players are puts in a room, having as their objective to fly and manager all aspects of a (badly working) spacecraft. Their goal is mere survival while trying to keep track and repair all malfunctioning systems, such as the radar, the combat system, the power management, O2 systems, and so on. When all crisis are in hands, they can try to progress on their way to salvation.

The flow of the game would be: Warp in a new zone, fight crisis, warp again, and repeat. Each new zone would get harder, bring new game mechanics, give more room to decision and need better teamwork.
All interfaces would be physical buttons, switches, analog meters, etc. Computer screen would be used to display important information, such as the radar’s.

On the technical side, the server, which is the pilot’s window and display the 3D world, keeps all important information and handle events. Multiple microcontroller and computer that are connected to the server send and receive data through MQTT (a TCP protocol).
My first build of the game was made using the game engine Panda3D. Due to some limitations, I switched to the more capable (and easier to use) engine: Unity3D. After yet more time, I switched to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), an awesome open source game engine that is definetly worth checking out.
There is still not much to show presently, but hopefully it's going to progress in the coming years!

## Here are some screenshot from the Unity3D Version
