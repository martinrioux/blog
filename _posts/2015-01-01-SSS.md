## SpaceShip Simulator (SSS)
Sometime, you've got a project that you really got to heart. For me, it's my SpaceShip Simulator.
I’ve always enjoyed games which engage interaction and I developed over the years an idea for a game in which players are puts in a room, having as their objective to fly and manager all aspects of a (badly working) spacecraft. Their goal is mere survival while trying to keep track and repair all malfunctioning systems, such as the radar, the combat system, the power management, O2 systems, and so on. When all crisis are in hands, they can try to progress on their way to salvation.
The flow of the game would be: Warp in a new zone, fight crisis, warp again, and repeat. Each new zone would get harder, bring new game mechanics, give more room to decision and need better teamwork.
All interfaces would be physical buttons, switches, analog meters, etc. Computer screen would be used to display important information, such as the radar’s.
On the technical side, the server, which is the pilot’s window and shows the 3D world keeps all important information and handle events. Multiple microcontroller and computer that are connected to the server send and receive data through MQTT (a TCP protocol).
My first build of the game was made using the game engine Panda3D. Due to some limitations, I switched to the more capable (and easier to use) engine: Unity3D.
There is still not much to show presently, but hopefully it's going to progress in the coming years!

The two versions are in the folders:
- [Panda3D - old version](./Panda3D%20-%20old%20version)
- [Unity3D - current version](./Unity3D%20-%20current%20version)

### Currently working
- Menu
    - A menu to select Server (pilot) or Client (consoles).
- Server
    - It's the "space ship". It contains all the ship info and display the 3D world. It also controls the ship using flight joysticks and other inputs.
- Consoles
    - These are the clients to the main game. They are used to display the different data to the player and transmit information when needed. For an easier development, the consoles include a “control panel” which displays a copy to all physical buttons. That way, no Arduino are needed to play the game. This panel won’t be needed once all is in place.
- Controls currently working
    - Power can be added and removed to different devices
    - A mechanical shield can be deployed (obfuscating the pilot’s view but protecting them)
    - Radar can be powered up, display surrounding objects, initiate a scan and display the object name once scanned.
    - Ship log logs ship logs.


Here is what I achieved with Panda3D for my SSS. Sadly, I had a more advanced version that got lost with time. Mainly, there were more controls and consoles had "modules" that displayed information.
I’ve included the python scripts and I can send the complete source on demand, but it was a little too big to include in this repository.
About Panda3D: Panda3D is an open source C++ game engine with python binding. There are no visual editors for this game engine.

This is the current version on which I am still working on.
Since Unity3D project tends to be heavy, only the scripts (code) of the game are included.

All code in the [code folder](./code)!
