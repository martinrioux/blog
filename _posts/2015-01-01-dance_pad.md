## Dance Pad

A simple code made to run a custom built Dance Pad.

The buttons are made with two layer of aluminum foil separated by soft foam. When the pad is pressed, the foam compress, the foil make contact and close the circuit. The look is not polished, but itâ€™s sturdy and responds well.

The [python script](https://github.com/martinrioux/portfolio/blob/master/dance_dance_pad/serial_read.py) converts the serial input received from the [Arduino](./DDPad.ino) to a keyboard command on the PC.
