I bought a broken Commodore 64 with the objective of converting it in an emulation station. I absolutely wanted the keyboard to be as authentic as possible, so I started with the project [tmk_keyboard](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) using a teensy and made the mapping for the Commodore layout. Finally, It can now be used in any computer as a generic USB keyboard, and the key mapping is really close to the original but yet fully functional with the help of multi-layer mapping.

I've put A Raspberry Pi 3 with RetroPie in it, a USB hub on the side and I now have an easy to carry emulation platform.

A small adaptation in the tool chain was necessary since the tmk_keyboard project targeted the Teensy 2.0 and I had a Teensy 3.0.
