I have started making RC planes in the summer 2015, and it is really a fun hobby! Not wanting the easy way with premade kits, my planes are made from blue Dow foam board (house insulation foam) shaped using a homemade handheld hot wire cutter.

Iâ€™ve also made planes with folded foam boards. All components were bought individually. My first plane never flew (at least not for long), but all the others did! The blue one is the one that I flew the most.
One of the things I really enjoy about making RC planes is all the physics surrounding it. The way the wings are shaped, where they are located on the plane, the location of the center of gravity are all examples of things that will affect the way your plane handles. You can make them more acrobatic, easier to handle, faster, slower; everything is up to the way they are made!
Also, the electronics allowing the control (transmitter and receiver) are pretty cool to mess with.
