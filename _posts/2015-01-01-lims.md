This is something that I started while working as a Microbiologist. This project has been running since December 2012.
Happenstance made it possible for me to start working on a new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Having the basic on how to program at that time and the help of my brother (Who's a Software Engineer) to get started, we started developping our own LIMS.

This was a MASSIVE project made with Ruby on Rails. Through a web interface, the employees can enter received samples, generate PDF of results and deliver them automatically, manage inventory and about everything else related to the operation of the laboratory.
Iâ€™ve then been tasked to make a second software through which the clients could access their results, make orders of sampling material and other useful tools.
Working on this software made me much better at coding, gave me more than basics about SQL databases and made me familiar with HTML, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby On Rails, database design and a lot more.
