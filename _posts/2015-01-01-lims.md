## Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).
This is something that I started while working as a Microbiologis. This project has been running since December 2012.
Happenstance made it possible for me to start working on a new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Having the basic on how to program and the help of my brother (Who's a Software Engineer) to get started, developping our own software was seen as a financial save over the cost of a commercial LIMS license.

It is a HUGE project made with Ruby on Rails. Through a web interface, the employees can enter received samples, generate PDF of results and deliver them automatically, manage inventory and about everything else related to the laboratory.
The direction being pleased with the software, I’ve then been asked to make a second software which the clients could use to access their results, make orders of sampling material and other useful tools.
I can’t share the code for this software since it belongs to the laboratory, but I've included some screenshot of it. For information, the git repository now counts over 138k lines of code.
Working on this software made me much better at coding, gave me more than basics about SQL databases and made me familiar with HTML, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby On Rails, database design and a lot more.
